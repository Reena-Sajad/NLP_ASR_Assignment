# NLP_ASR_Assignment
This repository contains my work for Assignment 1 of the Natural Language Processing (NLP) course. The notebook demonstrates foundational NLP techniques using Python and libraries like NLTK, SpaCy, and Scikit-learn. Key topics covered include:

- Text preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal, stemming, lemmatization)

- Part-of-speech tagging and named entity recognition

- Frequency analysis and n-grams

- Vectorization (Bag-of-Words, TF-IDF)

- Basic sentiment analysis and similarity measures

This assignment was part of a structured course curriculum and reflects hands-on application of theoretical NLP concepts on sample text datasets.
